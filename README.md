# Negativ-64 Portfolio

Hi, recently, I decided to rewrite my portfolio website enterely from scratch. Since now I am practising with React, I decided to use it here. 

You can find my porfolio here: https://negativ64-portfolio.vercel.app/

In additional, I wanted to make my portfolio site different from others, so I decided to make it in "terminal" style.

## 1. What i used?
- Create-React-App boilerplate
- React Hooks
- React Router Library
- React Icons Library 

## 2. Features
Well, the main feature of the portfolio (besides the my actual works) is the command line. I didn't make it too functional, there you can ask for help, jump to other pages with ```goto /location``` command and go back with ```goto /back``` command. Also, there are two commands: ```/commands``` and ```/question``` and one of them has Easter egg inside it.

## 3. Contacts
If you found any bug, you can either use pull request or you can contact with me. You can contact me via [email](mailto:bektemirovaziz64@yandex.com) or via [Telegram](https://t.me/Rick_Decart).

### Have a nice day!
